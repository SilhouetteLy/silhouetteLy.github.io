# Silhouette's Blog

[Silhouette's blog is here &rarr;](https://silhouettely.github.io/)

**Hello everyone, I am Silhouette, a Java programmer. Due to personal habits, I like to excerpt some favorite articles or lyrics, classic lines, etc., and also have some class notes and so on. It was recorded in a notebook before, but it is not convenient to check and supplement, and it is not very convenient to save. It is recorded by a computer after going to university. The commonly used ones are the notepad and notepad ++ that come with the computer, and then Use sublime to edit. After contacting Markerdown, use Typora to save notes. Personally think that Typora is very easy to use, but there is an obvious flaw is that it does not support the mobile terminal, so it can only be viewed and edited on the PC side. Of course, there are some Markerdown software that supports PC and mobile terminals, due to personal preferences and other factors have been abandoned. I had the idea of building a personal blog before, but due to various factors such as technology, this idea was not implemented consistently. Suddenly one day, a friend recommended me her blog and its construction process(Build a personal blog website based on github pages + jekyll). Just that time, I tried it, and then it was built.**

**The original intention of building a blog is to allow my PC-side notes to support mobile-side review. Now that the blog opinions are built, although it is not yet perfect, it will be gradually improved and completed later. The later stage is to migrate notes and so on to the blog. Good habits need to be persisted. Later, I will continue to refine and record my life through blogs.**
