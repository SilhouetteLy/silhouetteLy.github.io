## 前言

**Sailboats** was originally created for a project called *Seagull Orchestra*, but Adam Young later edited and re-recorded it and included it on Sky Sailing’s debut album *An Airplane Carried Me To Bed*. The title of this album is also included as a lyric in this song.

《**Sailboats**》最初是为名为*Seagull Orchestra*的项目创建的，但是Adam Young随后对其进行了编辑和重新录制，并将其包括在Sky Sailing的首张专辑*《飞机载我到床上》中*。这张专辑的标题也作为歌词包含在这首歌中。[链接](https://genius.com/Sky-sailing-sailboats-lyrics)

Sailboats wish that they were stars

航船许下化为星光的愿望

Floating softly in the sky

于夜空之中轻轻飘荡

Among our dreams that bid goodbye

于告别的梦中起航

Moving through transparent space

穿过透明暗雾

Drifting through the stratosphere

飘过高天仿佛

And onward 'till they disappear

直至消失在虚无

These continents' from overhead

浮在空中的大陆

Look like tiny paper shapes

一如折纸般的细小之物

Intricately set in place

散落此处

Below the misty mountain clouds

紧锁山头的浓雾

There's a lovely silver bay

掩映着银白的良港

Where sunset sailors often hide away

日落而息的水手们借暮色躲藏

Scuba diver in the lock

深湖潜水中的你

Speedboat driver on the dock

还有码头快艇上的你

Sailplane pilot in the blue' take me up there with you

以及天幕中滑翔机里的你，带我与你同行

The world looks brighter from this high altitude

登高望远时，世界渐而明朗

I was walking through the trees

我走过森林多娇

（Sailboats wish that they were stars）

航船许下化为星光的愿望

And I was swimming through the sees

我游过海洋浩渺

（'Cause they don't know who they are）

它们将自己淡忘

I was falling through the air

好似直落千丈之高

When it hit me right there

当我沉醉于这份奇妙

My eyes are tired

双眼沉重

I don't even care

亦有何扰

An airplane carred me to bed

飞机掠过把我捎到梦乡

Where I slept above the coast

我沉睡在停泊港湾之上

and dreamt I had become a ghost

梦里幻化为幽灵游荡

I sail above the frozen peaks

我航行在冰封山巅之上

Deep in cold cathedral caves

潜入大教堂洞穴的深寒

Across the hills and far beyond the waves

跨越万水千山与海浪翩翩

Take the car on the run

乘车奔上道途

Fly the jet to the sun

飞机亦在通往太阳之旅

And bring the spacecraft in soon

不久飞船也将上路

While I play chess with the moon

当我在棋盘上与婵娟酣战

I feel like sleeping through this cold afternoon

只愿于长梦中穿越这午后之寒

Once in 1964

一九六四年

Sailboats wish that they were stars

航船许下化为星光的愿望

An actress ran on the shore

海边奔过一位女演员

Cause they don't know who they are

它们将自己淡忘

And though you'll never return

纵你此去再无归返

I love you' Audrey Hepburn

奥黛丽·赫本，我仍将你思恋

Sometimes I can see your face in the crowd

人影往来，若见君颜

There are sailboats throughout this brilliant sky

划过苍穹的正是那些航船

But you cannot pick them out if you can't fly

但你若想触及，唯有扶摇而上

I'm glad the Earth doesn't care If I go up there

只幸我的脱离于地球来说无妨

If you want to' just ask me and I'll take you along

若你有意，我亦将携你翱翔
